# Balast — engineering handoff

Liquidity layer for Robinhood Chain. Users deposit into a token pool and collect a
proportional share of swap fees, paid in WETH. Two products: **Stakes** (passive,
one-token deposit, fees streamed over 7 days) and **Positions** (active, shaped
concentrated liquidity minted straight to the user's wallet). A third surface,
**Router**, lets token teams convert creator fees into permanent pool depth.

`depth.html` is the approved design prototype and the source of truth for layout,
copy, colour and interaction. Port its logic; do not redesign it. Where this doc
and the prototype disagree, this doc wins.

Read this file in full before writing any code. Build P0 only, then stop and report.

## 1. What is not negotiable

**Balast never takes custody.** Position NFTs are minted to the user's wallet.
Staked positions sit in a vault contract that only the depositing wallet can
withdraw from. There is no admin withdraw path, no pause that traps funds, no
upgradeable proxy on the vault.

**Rewards come from real swap fees only.** No token emissions, ever. If volume
slows, displayed yield slows with it. Never display a projected or subsidised APR.

**Fee yield is the headline metric, not volume.** Volume is trivially washed; fee
yield is what an LP actually earns. Every ranking defaults to fee yield.

**Displayed yield is trailing, never forward.** Label it `fee yield, trailing 7d`
everywhere. Never write "APY", never annualise a single day.

## 2. Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript | matches existing Fourtis projects |
| API | Fastify | same |
| DB | PostgreSQL + Prisma | same |
| Cache / streams | Redis | pending-harvest buffer, websocket fan-out |
| Indexer | viem + own log poller | Robinhood Chain has ~100ms blocks; see §4 |
| Contracts | Foundry, Solidity 0.8.26 | v4 hooks tooling is Foundry-first |
| Deploy | Hostinger VPS, PM2, Nginx | same as the rest of the stack |

Chain: **Robinhood Chain, chainId 4663**, EVM L2 (Arbitrum Orbit), native gas ETH.
Sequencer is first-come-first-served with ~100ms blocks, so **use timestamps, not
block numbers, for transaction deadlines**.

Known addresses to seed config (verify each on the explorer before mainnet):

```
WETH (aeWETH proxy)  0x0Bd7D308f8E1639FAb988df18A8011f41EAcAD73

```

Day-one stablecoin on this chain is **USDG**, not USDC. There is no Aave deployment.

---

## 3. Contracts

Four contracts. Keep them small and separately auditable.

### 3.1 `BalastZap`

Single-token entry. Takes ETH or one side of a pair, swaps the correct fraction,
mints the position, returns dust.

```
function zapMint(
  PoolKey  calldata key,
  int24    tickLower,
  int24    tickUpper,
  uint256  amountIn,
  address  tokenIn,
  uint256  minLiquidity,
  uint256  deadline
) external payable returns (uint256 tokenId);
```

- Swap fraction is computed off-chain and passed in; the contract enforces
  `minLiquidity` so a bad quote reverts rather than executing badly.
- Deadline is a **timestamp**.
- Dust below one wei-equivalent of gas is left in the contract; anything above is
  returned to the caller. Never silently keep dust.

### 3.2 `BalastShaper`

Builds a shaped position across N bins in one transaction. Uniswap v4 has ticks,
not bins, so a "bin" is one tick-range sub-position with its own weight.

```
struct Bin { int24 lower; int24 upper; uint128 weightBps; }
function mintShaped(PoolKey calldata key, Bin[] calldata bins, ...) external payable;
```

- `sum(weightBps) == 10_000` enforced on-chain.
- Max 60 bins per transaction — past that, gas and calldata make it worse than two
  transactions. Reject with a clear revert, do not silently truncate.
- Three shapes in the UI (spot / curve / bid-ask) are **weight generators in the
  frontend**, not contract modes. Keep the contract shape-agnostic so new shapes
  ship without a contract change.

### 3.3 `BalastVault`

One vault per pool. Holds staked LP, harvests fees, streams rewards.

Reward accounting is the Synthetix `StakingRewards` pattern, not a claim-on-demand
pool. The 7-day drip is what stops a wallet from depositing right before a harvest,
claiming, and leaving.

```
rewardRate        = pendingWeth / 7 days
rewardPerToken   += (now - lastUpdate) * rewardRate * 1e18 / totalSupply
earned(account)   = balance * (rewardPerToken - userPaid) / 1e18 + rewards[account]
```

- `notifyReward(uint256 amount)` extends the stream: leftover from the current
  window is folded into the new rate. Standard Synthetix `notifyRewardAmount` logic.
- `withdraw()` is always available, no lockup, no exit fee, no timelock.
- Protocol fee is taken **at harvest, from fees earned** — never from principal:

```
protocolFeeBps = 1000   // 10% of harvested fees
max allowed    = 2000   // hard cap in the constructor, cannot be raised
```

  The cap is constructor-immutable. A governance setter that can raise it to 100%
  is the single most common rug in this product category; do not ship one.

### 3.4 `BalastRouter`

For token teams: converts an accruing fee stream into pool liquidity.

- Trigger modes: `CADENCE` (every N seconds) or `MILESTONE` (at market-cap steps,
  each fires once, in ascending order).
- Pricing uses a **30-minute TWAP**, not spot, or the keeper call is a free sandwich.
- Slippage guard on every route; revert rather than route at a bad price.
- Keeper only *triggers*. Funds never leave the contract to the keeper. The keeper
  address is rotatable; the destination pool is not.
- `pause()` stops future routes and lets the owner withdraw **unrouted** fees only.
  Already-routed liquidity is not recoverable by anyone — say so in the UI.

### 3.5 Invariants for the test suite

- Vault: `sum(balances) == totalSupply`, always.
- Vault: a user who never claims and withdraws at time T receives exactly the same
  WETH as a user who claimed every hour. (Drip must not leak.)
- Vault: `protocolFeeBps` can never exceed the constructor cap.
- Vault: withdraw path works when `rewardRate == 0` and when the reward token
  balance is zero.
- Shaper: `sum(weightBps) != 10_000` reverts.
- Shaper: a 60-bin mint fits under the block gas limit.
- Zap: a quote that degrades between build and execution reverts, never partially
  fills.
- Router: a milestone fires at most once; milestones out of order revert at config
  time, not at route time.
- Router: routing at spot price when TWAP deviates more than the guard reverts.

---

## 4. Indexer

All pool data comes from on-chain events. No third-party price API in the critical
path — logos and token metadata may come from external sources, numbers may not.

**Sources**
- `PoolManager` v4: `Initialize`, `Swap`, `ModifyLiquidity`.
- v3 `UniswapV3Pool`: `Swap`, `Mint`, `Burn` — some older pools on this chain are v3.
- Launchpad hooks (Pons, Bags, Bottom.fun) emit their own swap events *before*
  graduation. Pre-graduation liquidity is not stakeable; index it for the listing
  but mark `stakeable: false`.

**Pipeline**
1. Poller reads logs in ranges, writes raw rows, tracks `last_indexed_block` per
   contract. Reorg depth on an Orbit L2 is shallow but non-zero: re-scan the last
   32 blocks each pass and upsert by `(txHash, logIndex)`.
2. Fee attribution per pool per hour into `pool_fee_hourly`. Fee yield is
   `fees_7d / tvl_now * 365/7 * 100` — compute it in SQL, never in the component.
3. Prices: derive from pool reserves and `sqrtPriceX96`, anchored to WETH, then to
   USD via the WETH/USDG pool. One anchor, one path, no averaging across venues.
4. Websocket pushes deltas to the client. The prototype's 3.2s tick is simulating
   this; in production, push on actual events and debounce to ~1s per pool.

**Schema sketch**

```
pools(id, address, chain_id, token0, token1, fee_tier, tick_spacing,
      hooks, protocol, created_block, stakeable)
tokens(address, symbol, name, decimals, logo_url, launchpad, first_seen)
pool_fee_hourly(pool_id, hour, fees_token0, fees_token1, fees_usd, volume_usd, swaps)
pool_state(pool_id, tvl_usd, price_usd, mc_usd, updated_at)     -- latest snapshot
vaults(pool_id, address, total_staked, reward_rate, period_finish, stakers)
stakes(wallet, vault_id, shares, claimed_weth, updated_at)
positions(token_id, wallet, pool_id, tick_lower, tick_upper, liquidity, shape, status)
router_configs(token, fee_source, mode, cadence_s, milestones_json, paused)
router_routes(config_id, tx_hash, weth_in, liquidity_added, twap_price, routed_at)
```

Rule: components read from a `DataProvider` interface. P0 ships a `SimProvider`
reproducing the prototype's generated data; P1 swaps in the live one. No component
imports data directly, so the swap is one file.

---

## 5. Design system

Take these from `depth.html` into `globals.css` as custom properties. Never
hardcode a colour in a component.

```css
--bg:      #050807;   /* page */
--panel:   #080D0B;   /* cards, table surface */
--panel-2: #0B120F;   /* row hover */
--raise:   #0E1714;   /* inset tracks, segmented control active */

--bd:      rgba(61,214,140,.12);   /* green-tinted border, pills and inputs */
--bd-2:    rgba(61,214,140,.26);   /* focus, active outline */
--bd-n:    rgba(255,255,255,.06);  /* neutral hairline, table rows and cards */

--fg:   #E6F2EC;  --fg-2: #8FA79B;  --fg-3: #5E7268;  --fg-4: #3D4D45;

--ac:     #3DD68C;  /* the one accent */
--ac-2:   #6FE8AC;
--ac-dim: rgba(61,214,140,.10);
--red:    #E5484D;  /* negative change only */
```

**Colour rule.** Green is the only accent and it means one of three things: brand,
a positive number, or an active control. Red means exactly one thing: a negative
number. Nothing else is coloured. Earlier iterations of this design failed because
colour was sprayed across the whole surface.

**Type.** JetBrains Mono throughout, Inter as the fallback stack only.
- Column headers, field labels, eyebrows: `10px / 600 / letter-spacing .16em / uppercase`
- Numbers: `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`, always
- Row values: 13px / 500. Token ticker: 14px / 700.
- Big figures (vault APR, stat cards): 24–38px / 700

**Components.** Card radius 14px, control radius 8–10px, pills 99px. Row hover is a
background lift to `--panel-2` plus a 2px green bar on the left edge. Transitions
150ms for hover, 450ms `cubic-bezier(.2,.7,.3,1)` for row reordering.

**Layout.** Fixed 232px labelled sidebar collapsing to a 64px icon rail below
1180px. Sticky top bar, 69px, holds search + the four global stats + wallet.
Columns drop by priority as width shrinks: `Vol 24h` and `Depth` at 1780px, `Age`
at 1560px. A table must never overflow its card.

---

## 6. Pages

### `/pools` — the listing
Featured pool card with 6 metrics and a full-bleed area chart; two smaller cards
(Most traded, Highest fee yield); then two live boards, Trending (sorted by volume)
and Established (sorted by fee yield), each with All / ETH / USDG quote filters.

Live behaviour, all visible in the prototype:
- values update in place, flashing green or red for ~1.1s on change
- rows reorder with a FLIP transform, never a jump
- row 1 carries a leader highlight
- a `Stake` button fades in on row hover and opens the drawer without navigating

### `/stakes`
Vault grid: trailing-7d fee yield as the headline figure, staked total, fees 24h,
staker count, next harvest countdown. Below it, the user's own stakes with a
7-day stream progress bar, claimable amount, and Claim / Compound.

### `/positions`
The shape builder. Left panel: token, deposit amount, shape (spot / curve /
bid-ask), range as ± percent, bin count. Right panel: live bin chart with the
current price marked, plus range, estimated fee yield, split at mint, fee tier.
Mint is one transaction and the NFT goes to the user.

### `/router`
Token-team surface. Fee source, trigger mode, destination range, then a plain
timeline of what will happen and a depth projection. Copy must state that routed
liquidity is permanent.

### `/portfolio`
Net value, fees earned, price impact vs holding, daily fee heatmap, position list
with in-range / out-of-range status and a rebalance prompt.

---

## 7. Honest-numbers rules

These are product rules, not style preferences. Breaking one makes the site
dishonest and it is the fastest way to lose LPs.

- Fee yield on a pool younger than 7 days is labelled `est.` and carries the pool
  age next to it. A 1-day-old pool showing 1200% is arithmetic, not an opportunity.
- Never display a yield figure computed from fewer than 24 hours of data. Show `—`.
- `Price impact on holdings` in the portfolio is the honest name for impermanent
  loss. Show it as a negative number next to fees earned, not buried.
- Out-of-range positions earn nothing. Say exactly that, in the row, in red.
- The protocol fee (10% of fees earned) is disclosed in the stake drawer before the
  user signs, not in a docs page.
- If the indexer is behind, show the lag in the top bar. Never render stale numbers
  as if they were live.

---

## 8. Build phases

**P0 — shell and simulated data.** Next.js scaffold, design tokens, all five pages
rendering against `SimProvider` with the prototype's generated data, including the
live tick, flash and FLIP reorder. Deploy. Nothing below changes a component.

**P1 — indexer.** Log poller, pool and token discovery, fee attribution, price
derivation, websocket. `/pools`, `/stakes`, `/portfolio` read real data. Still no
contracts.

**P2 — contracts on testnet.** `BalastZap`, `BalastShaper`, `BalastVault` with the
full invariant suite. `/positions` mints for real; `/stakes` stakes for real.

**P3 — keeper.** Harvest scheduler, WETH conversion, `notifyReward`. Monitoring and
alerting on missed harvests: a keeper that dies silently is a vault paying zero
while displaying a yield.

**P4 — router.** `BalastRouter` plus the token-team onboarding flow.

**P5 — audit, then mainnet.** No mainnet deployment of the vault before an external
audit. This is the one phase that cannot be compressed.

---

## 9. Acceptance criteria for the hard parts

**P1 is done when** re-running the indexer from block zero on a fresh database
produces byte-identical `pool_fee_hourly` rows to the incremental run, and a forced
32-block reorg replay changes no row count.

**P2 is done when** the vault invariant suite passes under fuzzing with 10k runs,
including: random deposit / withdraw / claim orderings across 50 wallets never
leave the vault unable to pay `sum(earned)`.

**P3 is done when** killing the keeper for 48 hours and restarting it distributes
exactly the fees accrued in that window, with no double-payment and no loss, and
the UI showed the harvest lag the whole time.

---

## 10. Open decisions for ALFA, not for the developer

- **Protocol fee rate.** 10% is in the spec and the prototype. Meteora runs ~10%
  and returns 90% to LPs. Going higher looks fine on a spreadsheet and loses the
  supply side. Confirm before the constructor is deployed, because the cap is
  immutable.
- **Minimum pool age before a pool appears in Established.** 7 days is assumed.
- **Whether Balast seeds its own liquidity in launch pools.** Affects whether the
  displayed TVL is honest as "user liquidity" or needs a separate line.
- **Domain and token.** ~~`Depth` is the working name.~~ **Decided: the product is `Balast`, on `balast.xyz`.** The token is still open — see §12.

## 12. P0 implementation notes

Added by the P0 build. Everything above this line is ALFA's handoff and is
unchanged; this section records where the implementation had to make a call, so
the next phase is not left guessing.

### Deviations from the prototype

The prototype contradicts itself or this document in four places. Per the rule
at the top of this file, this document won.

1. **Yield basis.** `depth.html` computes `fee*365/tvl` — 24h fees annualised,
   which §1 forbids. Implemented as `fees_window / tvl_now * 365/7 * 100`, with
   the window capped at the pool's own age, and the three states from §7
   (`—` under 24h, `est.` plus age under 7d, plain above).
2. **Bin-chart legend.** The prototype's legend and its fill code disagree on
   which side of the price is the token side. The code was taken as correct and
   the legend corrected to match it.
3. **Fee heatmap colour.** The prototype fills the portfolio heatmap with
   `rgba(124,140,255)` — a purple, which breaks the colour rule in §5. It is
   green, and the caption reads "brighter = more" because that is what it draws.
4. **Standalone totals.** The prototype's top-bar TVL ($4.91M) and featured
   fees ($318K) contradict the sum of its own pool rows ($15.1M and $108K).
   Every figure that can be summed from the pools is now summed from them, so
   the header cannot disagree with the table beneath it.

### The simulated clock

`SimProvider` advances **six hours of chain time per 3.2s tick**
(`SIM_HOURS_PER_TICK`). A trailing-7d figure is deliberately slow-moving: with
a real-time clock, measured over four minutes, the boards never reordered once,
so the FLIP reorder that §8 requires in P0 was not observable. Six hours a tick
rolls the window in about ninety seconds of watching. Only the simulated clock
is compressed; the displayed metric and its arithmetic are unchanged.

**This needs ALFA's sign-off**, because it is the one place P0 does not behave
like the approved prototype.

### Decisions taken on §10's assumptions

- **Established shows pools with 7+ days of fees.** §10 lists this as assumed;
  it is implemented and labelled `7d+` in the board header. Consequence: young
  pools appear only in Trending, so the `est.` and `—` states are visible in
  the stake drawer and the vault cards rather than on the boards.
- **Protocol fee is 10%**, with the cap constant at 2000 bps in `lib/chain.ts`.
  Still needs confirming before the constructor is deployed — the cap is
  immutable.

### One open product question

`/positions` shows an **Est. fee yield** for a range the user has not entered
yet: this pool's trailing-7d yield scaled by how tightly the range concentrates
it, capped at 6×. It is labelled `est. · from N% trailing` so the basis is on
screen, but it is still a forward-looking number, which sits awkwardly against
§1's "never display a projected APR". Options are to keep it as is, cap it
harder, or drop the figure and show only the concentration multiple. **ALFA's
call.**

### Not in P0

No indexer, no contracts, no keeper, no wallet connector — the wallet button is
a placeholder until P2. `lib/chain.ts` holds the §2 addresses, all of them still
unverified on the explorer. Deploy configuration (`ecosystem.config.js`,
`deploy/nginx.conf`) is committed, but nothing has been deployed: that needs
credentials for the VPS.


---

## 13. Naming and domain

**The product is `Balast`. The domain is `balast.xyz`.** §10 left this open; it
is now settled, and this section records what moved and what did not.

`Depth` was too generic to own: every short `depth.*` on a mainstream TLD is
registered and in use — `.com` `.org` `.io` `.so` `.xyz` `.fi` `.trade`
`.exchange` `.network` `.finance` `.ai` `.co` all checked and all taken.
`Ballast` was chosen for its meaning — weight carried low in a hull that gives
a vessel stability, which is what this product sells: stability from real fees,
not from emissions — and registered in its Indonesian spelling.

**The word "depth" stays wherever it is the domain term rather than the brand.**
Pool depth, market depth, the `Depth` column in the Established board,
`permanent depth` in the router copy, the `*DepthUsd` fields, `.depth-bar`,
`reorgDepth`, and `design/depth.html` are all unchanged. Only the brand moved.

The four contracts in §3 are renamed `BalastZap`, `BalastShaper`,
`BalastVault`, `BalastRouter`. None is deployed, so this costs nothing now and
would have cost an audit later.

### Still open

- **The token.** §1 forbids emissions, so a token cannot be a reward. That
  leaves governance or fee-share, and fee-share creates pressure on the one
  number §3.3 made immutable to protect LPs. Recommendation: ship without one.
- **`ballast.xyz`** — the English spelling on the same TLD — is registered and
  parked for sale by a third party. For a front-end that asks people to connect
  a wallet, a confusable domain someone else controls is a phishing domain
  pointed at our users. `ballast.fi` and `balast.fi` were both still free at the
  time of writing; registering them and 301'ing to the apex closes most of the
  exposure. `deploy/nginx.conf` carries the redirect stanza, commented out.
- **The mark reads as the letter M.** It was chosen while the product was called
  Depth, and it is now a mismatch for a B name. Recorded in `brand/README.md`.

---

## 14. P1 implementation notes

Added by the P1 build. §12 and §13 are unchanged. This section records what the
indexer can know, what it refuses to guess, and the two things it needs from
ALFA before it can index the real chain.

### What ALFA has to supply

**`USDG_ADDRESS`. The indexer will not start without it.** §2 names USDG as the
day-one stablecoin and §4.3 allows exactly one path to a USD figure: the
WETH/USDG pool prices WETH, and everything else prices through WETH. The
address is not in the handoff. With it unset every USD figure on the site would
be zero, so the process stops with that explanation rather than running and
reporting zeros.

**`START_BLOCK`.** The PoolManager's deployment block. Left at 0 the first sync
scans from genesis, which on ~100ms blocks is a very long time. Worse, a
`START_BLOCK` set *above* a pool's creation block means the indexer sees that
pool's outflows without the mint that funded them — see *unknown depth* below.

**`LAUNCHPAD_HOOKS`.** §4 says pre-graduation launchpad liquidity is listed but
not stakeable, and names Pons, Bags and Bottom.fun. Their hook addresses are
not in the handoff, so the variable is empty and every pool is currently
classified stakeable. That is the safe direction for a listing and the **wrong**
direction for a vault: P2 must not deploy a vault against a pool discovered
while this was blank.

The chain's own details were verifiable and are configured: chainId 4663 is
confirmed, and the four public RPC endpoints in `.env.example` come from the
`ethereum-lists/chains` registry. The §2 contract addresses in `lib/chain.ts`
are still unverified on the explorer.

### Rebuilt, never incremented

Every aggregate table is recomputed from the raw rows rather than added to.
This is the single decision the rest of P1 hangs off, and it is what makes §9's
acceptance criterion reachable at all: §4.1 requires re-scanning the last 32
blocks every pass, and an incremented total would double-count every one of
those rows. A rebuild over rows keyed `(tx_hash, log_index)` gives the same
answer however many times the same logs arrive, in what order, or in what
range sizes.

The consequence is a staging chain, because rebuilding everything from the raw
tables on each pass is a full scan:

```
swap_events, liquidity_events     raw, append-only, keyed by log coordinates
  -> weth_usd_hourly              the one USD anchor
  -> pool_flow_hourly             signed token flow, which gives reserves
  -> pool_fee_hourly              fees and volume per pool per hour
  -> pool_state                   latest price, reserves, TVL
```

`pool_flow_hourly` is not in §4's schema sketch and exists for a measured
reason. On v4 the PoolManager holds every pool's tokens in one balance, so
reserves can only be derived by summing the pool's own signed event amounts.
Summing the raw tables directly took 5-9 seconds a pass on a four-thousand-swap
fixture; staging it hourly brought a full sync to under a second.

**§9 is proven, not asserted.** `server/indexer/replay.test.ts` runs a
deterministic fixture chain of ABI-encoded logs through the real decoder, the
real ingest and the real SQL against a real Postgres, and compares every
numeric column **as text** — comparing Postgres `numeric` through a JavaScript
float would hide exactly the drift the criterion exists to catch. A block-zero
run and an incremental run produce identical rows; a forced 32-block reorg
replay changes not one row, let alone the count; ten replays of a 500-block
window change nothing.

### v4 emits no amounts for a liquidity change

`ModifyLiquidity` carries a liquidity delta, a tick range and no token amounts,
and those amounts are what a TVL figure is made of. They are computed at ingest
from the delta, the range and the pool's price — and the price used is the one
carried forward from the most recent `Swap` at or before that log's position in
the `(block, logIndex)` order, loaded from the database rather than held in
memory. That is deliberate: it makes the derived amounts a pure function of the
log prefix, so a restart mid-chain resumes with exactly the state a full replay
would have reached. Held in memory, the two runs would disagree and §9 would be
unprovable.

The tick maths is the TickMath constant table, ported exactly, with a test
comparing every constant against `sqrt(1.0001^t) * 2^96` computed
independently — a mistyped hex digit fails there rather than as a wrong TVL on
the site.

### What P1 does not know, and says so

- **Market cap.** Needs a circulating supply, which is not in the log stream.
  It is zero and the column shows an em dash. The prototype's MC figures were
  generated; there is no honest live equivalent without a token-supply source,
  and §4 bars a third-party API from the critical path.
- **Chain share.** The featured card's figure needs the chain's total
  liquidity to compare against. The PoolManager *is* the chain's v4 liquidity,
  so our share of what we index is 100% and meaningless. Zero until there is
  something real to divide by.
- **Vaults, stakes, positions, harvest payouts.** All need contracts, which are
  P2. The tables exist and are empty, the snapshot reports them empty, and the
  components already had empty states for it. Nothing is invented to fill the
  page.
- **Unknown depth.** A pool whose reserves sum negative means we never saw its
  funding mint — `START_BLOCK` was above its creation block. Its depth is
  *unknown*, not zero. Zero is recorded, and the deliberate consequence is that
  the yield shows as an em dash (§7) rather than a number divided by a divisor
  we know is wrong. The poller logs how many events it dropped for pools it
  does not know, so the cause is findable.
- **An absurd price.** Nothing stops someone initialising a pool at a tick that
  derives a price near 1e24 USD. Such a figure is discarded and the pool left
  unpriced, rather than clamped — a clamped value renders as a real TVL of ten
  quintillion dollars. It is also why it is discarded rather than allowed to
  overflow: an overflow throws inside the aggregation and stops the pass for
  *every* pool.

### Two honest-numbers rules P1 had to add

Neither is in §7, and both follow from it.

**The trailing window ends at the last block indexed, not at wall-clock now.**
If the indexer is an hour behind, wall clock counts that hour as zero fees and
quietly deflates every yield on the board. So the window is measured back from
chain time and the lag is reported separately, which is what the top bar shows.

**`LiveProvider` holds nothing rather than something invented.** If the API is
down or no block has been indexed, the snapshot stays null and the UI says
*waiting for the indexer*. It never falls back to `SimProvider`. A site that
silently swaps generated numbers in when the indexer dies is the exact
dishonesty §7 is about, and it is the failure mode §8's P3 criterion warns of
one phase early.

That null state is the one place P1 touched a component. The `DataProvider`
interface has allowed `getSnapshot()` to return null since P0 — "null if none
has arrived yet (live, pre-connect)" — but `SimProvider` is synchronous and
never did, so `MarketProvider` never handled it. It does now. No page changed.

### Still open

- **The §12 questions are still open.** The six-hours-per-tick simulator clock
  needs sign-off, and `/positions`'s forward-looking *Est. fee yield* still
  needs a decision. P1 changed neither.
- **`/stakes`, `/positions` and `/portfolio` have real but empty data.** §8
  lists `/stakes` and `/portfolio` as reading real data in P1, but both are
  about vault contracts that do not exist until P2. They read real data in the
  sense that they read the indexer and honestly report nothing in it.
- **Protocol fee at 10%, cap at 2000 bps.** Unchanged from §12, and the cap is
  still constructor-immutable, so it still needs confirming before P2 deploys.

---

## 15. P1 follow-up: the gaps §14 recorded, closed

Added after an audit of the P1 build. §14 is unchanged; this records what was
wrong with it and what is now true instead. Four of the six items were defects
in my own work rather than missing inputs.

### Market cap: §14 was wrong, and it mattered

§14 said market cap "needs a circulating supply, which is not in the log
stream". True but incomplete: `totalSupply()` is an ERC20 read, it is on chain,
and `server/chain/abi.ts` already declared it. The figure was available and I
left it at zero.

It mattered beyond a blank column. **§3.4's `MILESTONE` trigger mode fires at
market-cap steps**, so with the figure at zero `BalastRouter` could not work in
that mode at all — a P4 blocker created by being too conservative in P1.

It is now derived, with one honesty consequence carried through: total supply
includes locked, vested and treasury-held tokens, and none of that is
distinguishable on chain. That makes the figure **fully diluted value, not
market cap**, and presenting FDV as market cap overstates every token with a
vesting schedule, always in the flattering direction. So:

- `pool_state.mc_usd` is `totalSupply x price` of the traded side.
- `Pool.marketCapIsFdv` says which figure it is.
- The row marks it `fdv`, and the cell's title explains what is included.
- A token that will not report a supply shows an em dash, not a guess.
- Supply is re-read on a cadence, oldest first, a few tokens per pass — a
  mintable token's supply changes, and a stale supply is wrong in the
  flattering direction again.

**This is the one place P1's follow-up touched a component.** §8 says the
phases after P0 do not change components; §7 says a displayed number must be
labelled for what it is. Where those conflict §7 wins, because §7 is a product
rule and §8 is about implementation sequencing. The change is a qualifier and a
tooltip. **ALFA should know the MC column now reads as FDV** — if the intent
was circulating market cap, that needs a supply source, and §4 bars a
third-party API from the critical path.

### v3 pools were undiscoverable

`V3_FACTORY_ABI` existed and nothing listened for `PoolCreated`, so v3 pools
had to be hand-listed in `V3_POOLS`. §4 says some older pools on this chain are
v3, so the hand-list would have silently omitted every pool nobody thought to
add. The factory is now followed, discovered pools are reloaded from the
database on restart, and `V3_FACTORY` needs an address from ALFA.

Finding it surfaced a second bug that the test caught rather than production.
A v3 pool announced at block 20 whose `Mint` lands at block 30 has both in
blocks already read past — its own address was not in the log filter when they
were fetched — and the 32-block re-scan cannot reach back far enough. That mint
is the pool's entire starting liquidity: miss it and the reserves sum negative
and the depth is unknown for good. A newly discovered v3 pool is now backfilled
from its own creation block in the same pass.

### The API was unprotected, and health said nothing useful

`/api/snapshot` is the expensive query and it sat on a public endpoint in front
of one Postgres; one loop would have taken the site down. It is rate limited
now, generously — the front end polls every 20s behind the websocket and a
dozen tabs behind one NAT must not be throttled. The websocket is exempt,
because after a restart every client reconnects at once and those are exactly
the clients that most need to get back on.

`/api/health` returned 200 whenever the API answered, which is useless as an
alert: the indexer could be dead for a day and the endpoint would say ok. It
**returns 503 when the indexer is stalled or has never started**, so any uptime
check watching a status code catches it. `deploy/monitor.sh` runs from cron and
checks the same thing plus PM2, alerting on a change of state rather than every
five minutes for two days.

This is §8's P3 criterion arriving a phase early. It names the failure
precisely — "a keeper that dies silently is a vault paying zero while
displaying a yield" — and the indexer has exactly that shape now.

### Operational gaps that would have bitten

- **Log rotation.** Three processes, six log files, no rotation. The first
  symptom of a full disk is writes failing everywhere.
- **Backups.** `deploy/backup.sh`, nightly, 14 days. §9's determinism means
  the database can be rebuilt from chain, but that is a full re-sync from
  `START_BLOCK` — hours of climbing lag. The dumps are local, which protects
  against a bad migration and not against losing the box; getting them off the
  machine needs credentials, so `BACKUP_SYNC_CMD` is left for whoever has them.
- **Boot survival.** `bootstrap.sh` now verifies `pm2-balast` is actually
  enabled and says so loudly if not. Without that unit a reboot leaves nginx
  serving 502s.

### Verifying the addresses

`npm run verify:chain` checks every §2 address holds code, that the
PoolManager has emitted the v4 events we subscribe to — **decoded, not
counted** — and that WETH and USDG answer as ERC20s with the decimals the
price maths assumes. Run it before the first sync.

The check is worth the script because the failure is invisible: a wrong
`poolManager` starts cleanly, subscribes to an address that emits nothing, and
reports a lag that climbs forever. A site that looks like it works and has
nothing in it.

An earlier version of that script checked the event name against the ABI
instead of against the log, so it reported every event as found the moment any
log appeared — it would have passed a wrong address that happened to emit
something else. It decodes now.

### Token logos

`logo_url` existed and was never populated. §4 permits external sources for
logos and metadata and forbids them for numbers, so `server/indexer/logos.ts`
is the only file in `server/` that talks to anything but a node or the
database, and it reads `logoURI` and nothing else — not price, not supply, and
not decimals, which are an input to every price. A failure is silent and
total: no list, an unreachable host or malformed JSON leaves every badge on its
derived colour and changes not one number. It is opt-in via `TOKEN_LIST_URL`,
because there is no canonical list for this chain and guessing at one would be
worse than no logos.

### What is still not built, and is not a defect

P2's contracts, P3's keeper and P4's router are phases, not gaps. §8 orders
them and §8's P5 puts an external audit in front of any mainnet vault
deployment. Nothing in this section brings them closer.

The §12 questions are also still open: the six-hours-per-tick simulator clock
needs sign-off, and `/positions`'s forward-looking *Est. fee yield* needs a
keep, cap or drop. P1 and this follow-up changed neither.

---

## 16. The deploy bug that `.env` never being read caused

Recorded because it broke a real deploy and because the shape of the mistake
is worth keeping.

`deploy/bootstrap.sh` writes `/var/www/balast/.env` with the generated
database password and a slot for `USDG_ADDRESS`. **Nothing read it.** Node
does not read `.env` files — Next.js does, which is why the web process worked
— and PM2 does not either. The secrets deliberately do not go into
`ecosystem.config.js`, because that is in the repository. So the file was
written, nothing opened it, and `balast-api` and `balast-indexer` both died on
`DATABASE_URL is required` while pointing at a file sitting right there.

`ecosystem.config.js` even carried a comment saying ".env holds DATABASE_URL",
which was true and useless: it described where the value was, not how it would
arrive.

Fixed with `server/load-env.ts`, imported as the first line of every server
entry point. Three properties that matter:

- **The real environment always wins.** A variable already set by PM2, a
  shell, or CI is never overwritten, so `RATE_LIMIT_MAX=1 npm run api` does
  what it looks like it does.
- **The path resolves from the module, not from `cwd`.** PM2 sets a cwd, cron
  does not, and a deploy script may run from anywhere.
- **It is imported first in each entry point**, not only from `env.ts`,
  because several modules read `process.env` at their own top level and module
  evaluation order would otherwise decide whether they saw the file.

The parser is twenty lines rather than a dependency, and it keeps a `#` inside
a quoted value — the generated database password plausibly contains one, and
truncating it there produces an authentication failure that looks nothing like
its cause.

### And a second fault the same command exposed

`npm run verify:chain` failed on `DATABASE_URL is required` — a variable it
never uses. It imported `server/env.ts`, which validates every variable at
import, and the script's entire purpose is to check the chain **before** the
database matters.

The RPC endpoint list now lives in `server/chain/endpoints.ts`, which has no
database requirement; `env.ts` re-exports it so there is still one definition,
and `chain/client.ts` depends on it rather than on `env`. The verify script
imports neither `env` nor the database.

Eager validation at import is still the right default for the API and the
indexer — a typo'd variable should stop the process at boot rather than
produce an indexer quietly following the wrong chain. The lesson is narrower:
a module that validates everything should not be on the import path of
something that needs one thing.

### The test that guards the guard

`vitest.setup.ts` asserts `DATABASE_URL` is still the test database after the
loader has run. The suites truncate every table, and a developer with a real
`DATABASE_URL` in their `.env` must never have it win. The loader's
non-overwriting rule is what makes that safe today; the assertion is what
keeps it safe if the rule ever changes.

---

## 17. Deploy faults, and every token having a mark

Two deploy faults worth recording because of their shape, and the answer to
"every token must have a logo".

### A diagnostic that invented a failure

`doctor.sh` parsed `pm2 jlist` with grep, matching `"name":"x","pm2_env":{`.
PM2 puts `namespace`, `version`, `mode`, `pm_id` and `monit` between those two
keys, so the pattern never matched and the doctor reported **every process as
not running while the site was up and serving**. A tool that invents a failure
is worse than one that misses a real one: it sends you looking in the wrong
place. It parses the JSON with a JSON parser now.

### A repair tool that refused to repair

The doctor's `next` line pointed at `bootstrap.sh` when `.env` was missing.
`bootstrap.sh` then exited with "reset the password yourself", because the
database role already existed from an earlier run and the password was no
longer known anywhere. The one command meant to fix the box refused to fix the
most likely way it breaks.

It rotates the role's password and writes a fresh `.env` now. Rotating is safe
precisely BECAUSE the old password is lost — nothing can still be using it.

### Every token has a mark; some have logos

`lib/token-mark.ts` derives a badge from the token's own address: a
fixed-weight disc whose hue is unique to that address, carrying the ticker's
first two characters. Deterministic, so the server and the browser render the
same thing and a token never looks like a different token after a reload.

Saturation and lightness are fixed rather than derived. Deriving them
eventually produces a near-black token invisible on a near-black page, or one
close enough to the accent green that §5's colour rule stops meaning anything.

The ink is chosen per hue, and that is not fussiness: **yellow at this
lightness is far brighter than blue at the same lightness**, so no single ink
stays legible across the wheel. Measured, a fixed dark ink bottoms out at
1.72:1. Per-hue selection holds 4.26:1 across all 360 hues, and there is a
test that re-derives that number rather than trusting this paragraph.

That test caught a real bug in the first version: the ink luminances were
hardcoded, and wrong — 0.0106 against a true 0.0044 — which flipped the ink
choice on part of the wheel and quietly cost 0.3 of contrast. They are
computed from the hex now. A constant that has to agree with another constant
is a constant that will eventually disagree with it.

**Real logos** still come only from a token list, per §4. The change that
makes that usable: `TOKEN_LIST_URL` now accepts a local path, and
`config/tokens.json` ships with the repository. Robinhood Chain has no public
token list, so waiting for one meant no token would ever have a real logo;
now whoever knows the tokens can add them today, in the same Uniswap
token-list shape, and switching to a public list later is one line. Only
`logoURI` is read — not price, not supply, and not decimals, which are an
input to every price.

A listed logo that changes now replaces the recorded one, rather than only
filling a blank. A corrected logo should reach the site without anyone
truncating a table to make it happen.

### The hardcoded database port

`bootstrap.sh` created the role and database over postgres's **unix socket**,
which finds the default cluster whatever port it listens on, and then wrote a
`DATABASE_URL` with a hardcoded `5432`. Where those disagree the database
exists and the URL cannot reach it, and the error — `P1001: Can't reach
database server` — reads exactly like postgres being down.

This is not an edge case on a shared box. Debian puts a second cluster on
5433 when 5432 is taken, and this VPS already ran PostgreSQL for other sites.

Detecting the port turned out to be its own small problem: `psql` cannot
answer it, because its socket is named `.s.PGSQL.<port>` and it defaults to
5432 — asking the cluster its port over the socket requires already knowing
the port. `deploy/pg-port.sh` asks the system instead, in order of
authority: Debian's cluster registry, then the socket files, then a TCP
listener. Every socket `psql` call in bootstrap now passes `-p` for the same
reason.

Bootstrap also corrects the port in an existing `.env` rather than leaving it,
because the port is a fact about the machine and not a preference — verified
against a password containing `#` and `&`, where only the port changes.

### A verdict that ranked the wrong failure

The doctor ranked failures by dependency order alone, so with the database
unreachable AND `USDG_ADDRESS` empty it told the operator to go look up a
token address. Those are independent: an empty `USDG_ADDRESS` stops the
indexer and nothing else, while an unreachable database stops everything.

There are two tiers now. `first` is for a failure the rest of the box cannot
work around; `also` is for one that blocks only itself. The verdict prints
`next` and then `then`.

The database check also says **which** failure it is, rather than "cannot
connect": cluster down, wrong port in `.env`, `listen_addresses` refusing
127.0.0.1, or bad credentials. The generic message sent someone to check
whether postgres was running — and it was, on another port.

### An API that died instead of explaining

`start()` threw on a missing `USDG_ADDRESS` and refused to listen. On the real
box that produced 24 restarts, no explanation anywhere, and a front end that
could not even ask what was wrong — while the page it served said only
"waiting for the indexer", which was true and useless.

That is backwards. The API is the one process in a position to say what is
missing, and a configuration error should be loudly visible rather than fatal.
It starts now, and reports:

- `/api/health` → 503 with `status: "misconfigured"` and a message naming
  both the variable and the two commands that set it.
- `/api/snapshot` → 503 with the same reason rather than a bare "no data".

**Misconfiguration outranks `never-indexed`** in that status, deliberately: a
chain with no indexed blocks is the SYMPTOM of an indexer that cannot start,
and reporting the symptom sends whoever is looking to the wrong place.

The indexer still refuses to start without the anchor, and that stays right —
it would otherwise write rows priced at zero. PM2's `errored` state is the
visible signal there.

`components/providers/AwaitingIndexer.tsx` asks `/api/health` and shows the
reason under the honest-empty message. The waiting page now tells an operator
what to fix instead of leaving them to guess, which is the difference between
a blank wall and a diagnosis.

### The anchor finds itself

`USDG_ADDRESS` was the one value nothing could proceed without, and the only
one no machine could supply — §2 names USDG but not its address. So the
indexer refused to start, the API refused to start, and the site sat on a "not
configured" page waiting for a step only a person could take. For hours.

That was the wrong shape for the problem. **The indexer already reads every
token's symbol off its own contract while discovering pools.** The answer was
in its own tables the whole time.

`server/indexer/anchor.ts` looks: the token calling itself USDG that trades
against WETH, ranked by swaps. `USDG_ADDRESS` still overrides it, and a
*malformed* override is still refused — somebody meant to pin a specific token
and mistyped it, and quietly pricing the whole site off a different one cannot
be detected from anywhere downstream.

Where it will not guess: with two tokens claiming the symbol it picks the one
with real depth, **says which and why**, and reports both. `/api/health`
carries `usdgSource` and `usdgNote`, because the anchor is the single most
consequential value in the system — a wrong one makes every dollar figure
wrong — and it has to be auditable from outside the box.

The ordering works because of a decision made much earlier for a different
reason. Aggregates are REBUILT, never incremented (§14), so the indexer can
write raw rows with no anchor at all, discover it several passes later, and
the next rebuild prices everything retroactively. No second scan of the chain.
There is a test proving the early hours — indexed before any anchor was
known — end up carrying USD figures, and another proving the result is
identical to having configured the address up front.

`START_BLOCK` and `V3_FACTORY` remain genuinely optional rather than
discovered: the first is a performance choice, the second cannot be inferred
from logs the factory itself emits.

### The crash loop: a price computed and thrown away

With the anchor discovering itself the indexer finally reached the real chain
— and then stopped on every pass with "No price known for pool … the batch is
missing its Initialize", retrying the same range forever and indexing nothing.

Three of my own mistakes in a line:

1. `planIngest` computes `plan.states`, which carries the price from
   `Initialize`. **Nothing ever wrote it.** The field was built and never
   persisted.
2. `loadPriceState`'s fallback read `pool_state.sqrt_price_x96`, which
   `rebuildPoolState` takes from the pool's LAST SWAP — so a pool that has not
   traded yet has zero there and was filtered out by the `> 0` condition.
3. And skipping the aggregation when no anchor exists left `pool_state` empty
   regardless.

So a `ModifyLiquidity` for a pool created in an earlier pass had no price, and
v4 emits no token amounts on that event, so it could not be valued.

**The Initialize price now lives on the pool row** (`init_sqrt_price_x96`,
`init_tick`) — an immutable fact from the log, which makes the state loaded
from the database exactly what an in-memory replay would have had. §9 still
holds; there is a test for that alongside the fix.

The second half matters as much: it **threw**. One pool's reserves being
unvalued is a far smaller loss than every pool's data being frozen, and §7
already renders unknown depth as an em dash. Such an event is now recorded on
the plan and logged, and the pass completes.

### Starting from genesis

Left at `START_BLOCK=0` the indexer scans from block zero. On this chain that
is 62 million blocks of mostly nothing — some thirty thousand passes before
reaching anything worth indexing, and the observed run was at block 7,872
after several minutes.

`eth_getCode` is empty before a contract exists and non-empty after, which is
monotonic, so `server/chain/deployment.ts` bisects for the PoolManager's
deployment block in about 26 calls and starts there.

It needs an archive node, and a pruned one answers old blocks with empty —
which would look exactly like "deployed at head" and set a `START_BLOCK` above
every pool's creation, so each pool's funding mint would be missed and its
depth would read as unknown for good. That case is detected and the search
abandoned rather than trusted.

Writing the test for it found a real bug: the genesis probe sat outside the
bisection's try/catch, so a pruned node would have thrown at indexer startup
instead of falling back.

### Thirty-four hours of empty blocks

With the crash loop fixed the indexer ran, and the next problem was arithmetic:
block 47,000 of 62,644,703, at 2,000 blocks a pass. Some thirty thousand round
trips — about thirty-four hours — before reaching anything worth indexing.

The deployment-block bisection was supposed to skip that, and it correctly
refused to: **all four public endpoints are pruned**, so `eth_getCode` cannot
answer for an old block. It said so and fell back rather than guessing, which
is right — a `START_BLOCK` above a pool's creation means never seeing the mint
that funded it.

So the fix is on the other side: the range adapts. Empty ranges double toward
a ceiling, busy ones halve back, and once the indexer is following head it
returns to the floor, where a narrow window keeps latency low.

The ceiling is learned rather than configured. Endpoints cap `eth_getLogs`
differently and none announce it, so the poller starts optimistic, and the
first refusal — "query returned more than N results", "block range too large"
— halves the width and records a ceiling it stays under. The cursor does not
move on a refusal, so nothing is skipped.

The property this could not cost is §9. A window that changes size mid-sync is
a harder version of the block-zero-versus-incremental comparison that
criterion is built on, so there is a test producing byte-identical
`pool_fee_hourly` rows from an adaptive run and a fixed-window one.

The indexer also logs every pass while backfilling now, with percentage and
blocks remaining. It previously logged only passes that found something, and
on a chain that is mostly empty an hour of silence is indistinguishable from a
hang.

---

## 18. The anchor that was already indexed

Recorded because the site sat on **"looking for the USD anchor"** on every
page while the pool it was looking for was in its own tables.

### Uniswap v4 has no WETH

A v4 pool's currencies are a `PoolKey`, not a token pair, and a pool that
trades ether holds it **natively**: `currency0` is `address(0)`, not the
wrapper. §2 gives aeWETH's address and §4.3 says everything prices through
ether, so every currency comparison in the indexer was written against that
one address — the anchor search, `findAnchorPool`, the USD `CASE` in each of
the three aggregation steps, and the snapshot's listing filter.

So an ETH/USDG pool — the likeliest anchor this chain has — was indexed,
counted, and invisible to all four. The failure then cascaded exactly as it
was designed to: no anchor means `buildSnapshot` returns null (§14: hold
nothing rather than invent something), and null means all five pages show the
waiting panel. One unmatched address blanked the site.

The consequence was never limited to the anchor. Every ETH-quoted pool on
this chain was excluded from the listing by the same comparison, so pinning
`USDG_ADDRESS` by hand would have produced a working anchor and a still-empty
board.

`lib/chain.ts` now owns both spellings, and `isEtherSql` is the one SQL
comparison, exported for the same reason `tradedSide` is: the places that
answer "which side is ether" disagreed once already. Treating the two as one
asset is a statement about the wrapper rather than a convenience — aeWETH
mints one token per ether deposited, so pricing a native pool through the
wrapped anchor is exact, not an approximation. They stay separate rows in
`tokens`: different addresses hold different balances, and merging them would
make a pool's reserves unreconstructable from its own events.

Ether is also now **read** rather than probed. There is no contract at
`address(0)`, so `readToken` failed all four calls and fell back to a
truncated-address symbol and — the part that would have hidden this — to 18
decimals, which happens to be right. It answers from `CHAIN.nativeCurrency`
instead, with no supply, because ether's is not an ERC20 read and a fully
diluted value for it would be invented (§7). It is also excluded from the
supply-refresh queue, which is ordered nulls-first: left in, it would have
held one of the few slots a pass has, for ever.

`server/indexer/native-eth.test.ts` is the proof. It builds the same fixture
chain out of native-ether pools and runs the real poller, the real SQL and
the real snapshot over it; against the pre-fix comparison four of its six
assertions fail, starting with the anchor. The older suites could not have
caught this: their fixture is built from wrapped pools, so it proved the
wrapped path and assumed the native one did not exist.

### The waiting page could not tell waiting from stuck

"Looking for the USD anchor" is the same sentence in two situations that call
for opposite actions. A first sync that has not reached the pools yet needs
someone to wait. A sync that is caught up and found no ETH/USDG pool needs
someone to look at the addresses, and waiting is the one thing that cannot
help it. The page said the sentence and not the fact that separates them.

`/api/health` now carries the chain head, blocks behind, percentage and a
`syncing` flag, and the waiting page draws them. The head is recorded on the
cursor by the poller each pass (`indexer_cursors.head_block`, one migration),
so answering costs no RPC call and the endpoint cannot itself be the thing
that is stuck. `deploy/doctor.sh` learned the same distinction — it had no
case for `no-anchor` or `misconfigured` at all, and reported the one state
the box was actually in as "unexpected health body".

### A hardcoded pair of decimals, used by nothing

`PriceAnchors` carried `wethDecimals: 18` and `usdgDecimals: 6`. Every ratio
in the aggregation reads decimals from the `tokens` rows of the pool it is
pricing, which is the only place they are true, so these two were dead — and
a dead field that looks authoritative is one somebody eventually believes.
Had anything read them, a USDG with 18 decimals would have put every dollar
figure on the site out by twelve orders of magnitude. Removed.

### What this does not settle

Whether this chain's pools are native, wrapped, or both is now irrelevant to
the code — all three work — but the §2 addresses are **still unverified on
the explorer**, and a wrong `poolManager` produces the same blank site with a
different cause. `npm run verify:chain` answers that, and `npm run
find:tokens` lists what the chain actually trades (native ether included, now
that it is named rather than printed as an unknown address).

Unchanged and still open: `V3_FACTORY` and `LAUNCHPAD_HOOKS` (§14), the
six-hours-per-tick simulator clock and `/positions`'s forward-looking *Est.
fee yield* (§12), and the protocol fee's immutable cap before P2 deploys.

### Postscript: the deploy that deployed the wrong branch, and two tools that lied

The first deploy after §18 changed nothing on the site, and the reason is
worth keeping. `deploy.sh` on the box hardcoded the previous session's
branch, so `bash deploy.sh` fetched, built and reloaded that branch and
reported success. The version of `deploy.sh` that reads `BRANCH` from the
environment only helps once it is on disk — so the first deploy of any new
branch is a manual `git checkout` followed by `deploy.sh`, and the doc says
so now rather than assuming.

The same box then showed what the first sync actually looks like: block
3,079,887 of ~62.6 million, chain time seventy days behind head, 665 pools
and 44k swaps already in the tables. That is the `syncing` case §18 added
the progress bar for, and it means the anchor may simply not have been
reached yet — waiting is correct, and the native-ether fix is what makes the
wait end when it is.

Two operator tools then invented failures. `verify:chain` and `find:tokens`
each asked every endpoint for 5,000 blocks of logs, were refused by all four
— the caps differ and none are announced — gave up on the first refusal, and
reported "no events in the last 0 blocks" as a fact about the PoolManager
address. `verify:chain` also still failed on an unset `USDG_ADDRESS`, a
value the indexer had been discovering for itself since §17, and told the
operator not to start the sync. `deploy/doctor.sh` did the same. A
diagnostic that reports its own limitation as the patient's fault is the
worst kind (§17), and both did.

`server/chain/logs.ts` is now the one backwards walk, and it narrows on a
refusal the way the poller does — the same range, retried at half the width,
nothing skipped — with a test against a capped fake endpoint. Both scripts
use it, and a walk that is refused even at the floor is reported as an
endpoint problem, never as an address problem.

And a scan from head can only ever see pools *created* in the window it
scans; the anchor pool was created once, months ago. `npm run tokens:indexed`
reads the indexer's own tables instead — every token it has met, ranked the
way the anchor search ranks — and prints exactly the resolution the indexer
and the API would make. It touches no endpoint, so it works when every public
RPC is refusing, which on this chain is the normal state.

### The first real snapshot: TVL $0 everywhere, and a page that crashed on it

The branch reached the box, the anchor resolved, and the site rendered for
the first time against real data — with `TOTAL FEES $805`, `TVL $0`, and
`/pools` on the error boundary: *Reduce of empty array with no initial
value*. Three faults, each only visible with a late anchor.

**Flow was skipped along with the priced tables.** `pool_flow_hourly` is
token amounts, not dollars, and needs no anchor; but the poller skipped the
whole aggregation while the anchor was unknown. On the real chain that was
the first few million blocks. When the anchor finally resolved, the bounded
rebuild staged flow for the discovering pass's hours only, so every pool's
reserves were its recent swaps minus the mint that funded it: negative,
therefore *unknown depth* (§14), therefore TVL $0 on every row and in the
top bar. Flow is staged every pass now, anchor or not.

**"Retroactive" was bounded.** §17 says the pass that discovers USDG prices
history; the rebuild it ran was scoped to that pass's hours, so it did not.
A change of anchor — including none to found, and including a restart — now
runs one unbounded rebuild of every priced table. Once per anchor, and the
restart case is deliberate: it makes a repair on a live box a redeploy, not
a migration.

Neither was catchable by the existing fixtures, whose anchor pool is created
at block 1 — the anchor is known from the first pass and nothing is ever
skipped. `server/indexer/late-anchor.test.ts` creates it two thirds of the
way through the chain, syncs in windows small enough that several passes
complete before it exists, and asserts two things: every pool's depth is
known, and the rows match — as text — a sync that had the address configured
from the start. Against the old poller the first fails with exactly the box's
symptom (`expected 0 to be greater than 0`) and the flow table is missing
half its hours.

**The page crashed on an honest empty.** `MiniCards` ranked pools with
`reduce` and no initial value: an empty list throws, and the "highest fee
yield" card filters to pools with seven days of fees, which on a young chain
is none. A card that should have said "not yet" took the whole page to the
error boundary. Both rankings go through a `maxBy` that returns null, and
null renders a quiet card with the reason.

Smaller: the top bar read `5937929s behind`, which is honest and unreadable;
it reads `68d 17h behind` now (§7 wants the lag shown, not encoded).

### "Stalled" was measured on the wrong clock

With the site finally rendering, the deploy summary's last line read
`STALLED, 5876521s of chain time behind` — for an indexer that was writing
a pass every second. Health judged a stall by **chain lag**: how old the
newest indexed block is. During a first sync that is seventy days, by
definition, while nothing is wrong; and the monitor would have alerted the
whole forty hours, which is how a monitor gets muted.

Liveness is a different clock: wall seconds since the poller last wrote the
cursor (`idleSeconds`). `stalled` is that clock past the threshold — the
process is dead or stuck — and nothing else. Chain lag stays what it was,
the honest figure in the top bar (§7), and two states carry it without
paging anyone: `syncing` (writing, far from head — the first sync, with its
percentage) and `behind` (writing, near head in blocks, but the newest block
is older than the threshold — catching up). Both answer **200** with
`ok: false`; 503 is reserved for states a person has to act on. A pass that
finds head has not moved still touches the cursor, so a quiet chain cannot
read as a dead poller.

`pm2-logrotate` in the process list is deliberate (§15, log rotation): a
first sync logs every pass for forty hours, and without rotation the first
symptom of that is a full disk.

### The first board: dust, `0000…0000`, and three figures that claimed too much

With the boards rendering, the listing showed what a young chain's
PoolManager actually contains, and four things needed saying.

**The listing bar.** 2,343 pools, most of them launchpad dust with a few
dollars of depth, sorted by volume — the pools anyone would stake into were
buried. `LISTING_MIN_FDV_USD` (env, default $1M, `set-env.sh` to tune) is
the bar for a pool's token to be listed. Below it a pool stays indexed and
counted in `/api/health`, and reappears the moment it crosses. The
ether/USDG market is exempt: ether has no supply to read, so its FDV is zero
by construction (§15), not by size. The bar is applied in the snapshot query,
so the header still sums the pools it shows (§12). **This is ALFA's number**;
$1M is a first guess at "big", not a measurement.

**`0000…0000 / Unknown token` as the most-traded market.** That row is ether.
It was written by the version of `readToken` that did not know address(0)
(§18), and `tokens` rows are written once and left alone — right for a
contract's facts, wrong for a row that was wrong. `repairNativeToken` asserts
the constants on every start.

**Three claims about unknowns.** `$0 MC` for ether, where §15 says an em
dash; `▲ +0.0%` in green for a pool with no price a day ago — the anchor was
younger than a day in chain time, so *every* row said it — where the honest
figure is a dash in no colour; and the top bar clipping `$3,801,09x` to
`$3,801,09`, a number that is simply wrong. `change24hPct` is nullable now
and rendered as a dash, the headline average is weighted over the pools
whose change is known, and headline figures go compact past $1M.

**The panel said "no indexed blocks" over a line saying which block.** The
first page load can arrive before the first snapshot does; with the indexer
priced and syncing, the copy now says the snapshot is loading rather than
that nothing has been indexed.

**Logos.** Every token has its derived mark; real logos come only from a
token list (§4, §17). Robinhood Chain has none, and this session cannot
verify whether any aggregator carries the chain, so nothing is wired to a
guessed URL. With the bar in place the listed set is small enough to curate:
`config/tokens.json`, Uniswap token-list shape, `logoURI` only, picked up on
the indexer's next pass.

### One row per token, and a fixture that had been lying about NVDA

The first filtered board listed CASHCAT twice and the ether market twice.
A token on this chain routinely has several pools — fee tiers, hooked
variants — and the query returned one row per pool. The board is a token
listing (§6, and every row of the prototype), so a token's row is now its
deepest pool: the one the Stake button opens and the one a yield figure
honestly describes. Shallower pools stay indexed and unlisted, and the
header sums the rows it shows (§12).

Writing the test for it found a fixture bug that had been there since P1.
The fixture derives a log's tx hash from `(block, logIndex)`, rows are keyed
by exactly that (§4.1), and every pool's seed logs sat at indices 0 and 1 of
its init block — so two pools created in block 1 collided, and the second
pool's funding mint was silently dropped. **NVDA/WETH in the default chain
has had unknown depth all along**, and the suites tolerated it because the
yield-state assertions accept `insufficient` where they should not have had
to. Seed logs sit at index 1000+ now, above anything a block's swap counter
reaches. Nothing in the indexer changed; the fixture simply stopped
contradicting the chain it stands in for.

The `0000…0000 / Unknown token` row on that board is the ether market,
still carrying the row an earlier `readToken` wrote. `repairNativeToken`
runs on the indexer's first pass after a restart and logs when it does; the
pass is preceded by the deployment-block bisection and the full rebuild, so
the label lags a deploy by a minute or two.

### "Loading the snapshot" on every refresh, and logos from outside

**Every refresh waited on the expensive query.** Two things multiplied.
The API answered `/api/snapshot` from its cache only when the cache was
younger than the stream debounce — one second — and every websocket client
forced its own rebuild on every indexer tick, which during a first sync is
every second. So the query that prices, sums and sparklines every pool ran
continuously, page loads queued behind it, and the panel sat on screen for
as long as the queue was. And the query did all of that work for every pool
before applying the listing bar: 2,600 pools of correlated lookups for a
board of fifty.

The bar is a `listed` CTE now, in front of every per-pool CTE. And the
snapshot is served **stale-while-revalidate**: the last build is answered
immediately, a rebuild starts in the background at most once per
`SNAPSHOT_MIN_REBUILD_MS` (five seconds), and a socket is pushed only when
the revision changed. The first request after a start is the only one that
waits. A few seconds of staleness is invisible next to the lag the top bar
already shows (§7).

**Logos.** §4 permits them from outside, and the list in `config/tokens.json`
was never going to cover a launchpad chain. `server/indexer/logo-sources.ts`
asks CoinGecko, DexScreener and (with `CMC_API_KEY`) CoinMarketCap for one
image URL per token and nothing else — not price, not supply, not decimals.
One token every `LOGO_LOOKUP_MS`, listed tokens first, a miss not asked
again for a week (`logo_checked_at`, one migration), a source that does not
know this chain disabling itself and saying so once. CoinGecko's platform id
is discovered from its platform list by chainId 4663 rather than guessed.

**What is not verified:** the session that wrote this could not reach any
of those services, so the parsers are written to the documented shapes and
treat anything else as "not found". Whether CoinGecko or DexScreener has
this chain at all is a fact the indexer will discover on the first pass and
log. The token list remains the override, and the derived mark remains what
renders when nothing else does. Launchpad sources (Pons, Bags, Bottom.fun)
need an endpoint from someone who knows them — each is one function here.

### Depth, and a second typeface on the table

ALFA looked at the first real board and asked for something that reads as
premium. Two answers, one shipped and one offered.

**Shipped: materials.** Every surface is now lit from above — a one-pixel
highlight on the top edge, a faint gradient down the first third, a shadow
that falls away below — and the page has a soft vignette behind it. Token
badges have a sheen and an inner shadow, so a derived mark reads as a coin
rather than a sticker; the top bar is glass; the brand button has a gradient
and a glow. All of it is neutral light on neutral surfaces: the colour rule
(§5) is untouched, and green still means brand, positive, or active. Badges
paint their colour with `backgroundColor` now, because the `background`
shorthand wiped the sheen.

**Offered, not shipped: Inter for UI text.** §5 says JetBrains Mono
throughout, and the mono-everywhere look is the "terminal" in the terminal
aesthetic. `html.sans` is an opt-in class that sets labels, names and copy
in Inter and keeps every figure in tabular mono so columns still line up.
Both were rendered locally at the width ALFA actually sees — 1280 CSS px,
which is a 1920 display at 150% — and sent as screenshots. Enabling it is
one class on `<html>`; it stays off until ALFA picks.

Verified with Playwright against the built site and simulated data. On the
live site the largest difference is not CSS at all: monogram badges and
flat sparklines are what a first sync looks like, and real logos are what
change the feel most. See the logo-sources note above for where those come
from and what is still unverified.

## 19. The Journal: a light design system, chosen over §5

Added when ALFA looked at the first real board and asked for something that
reads as premium. §5's dark terminal was the approved prototype; ALFA chose
a different direction from a set of sketches (`design/directions/`, artboard
**B3 · Journal**), and this section records what that changed and what it
deliberately did not.

### What moved

**Paper, not a terminal.** Warm off-white page, white cards, ink-dark text,
one green. The tokens in `app/globals.css` are the whole palette; the names
§5 introduced (`--bg`, `--panel`, `--fg`, `--ac`, `--red`, and so on) are
kept so that no component changed a variable name, only its value. Every
foreground colour was measured against the paper rather than picked by eye:
`--fg-3`, the quietest text that carries a label, is 4.4:1; the accent is
4.3:1 on paper and 4.8:1 on white; `--fg-4` is decorative only.

**Three typefaces, each with one job.** Instrument Serif for headlines and
the rank numerals, DM Sans for everything read, IBM Plex Mono for everything
counted. The `.num` class now sets the mono face as well as tabular figures,
so a number is a number wherever it appears. §5's "JetBrains Mono
throughout" is the one rule of §5 this replaces outright.

**Navigation across the top.** The fixed sidebar and the 64px icon rail are
gone; `components/shell/TopNav.tsx` holds the brand, the five pages, search,
the freshness chip and the wallet. Below 900px it takes two rows, stops
being sticky, and the links row scrolls inside itself — the page never
scrolls sideways, which the shell test still asserts at 360px.

**A masthead on every page.** `components/shell/Masthead.tsx`: eyebrow,
serif headline, a line of copy, and the four global figures as a labelled
facts column on the right — Positions, Value locked, Paid to LPs all time,
ETH — over one heavy rule. §5 put those four figures in the top bar as
unlabelled pills; here they have room for their names. On `/pools` the
headline *is* the day's numbers: how many markets are listed and what they
paid in fees over the last 24 hours, both summed from the rows beneath it
(§12), and the dateline is chain time — now less the indexer's lag — because
a dateline is a claim about when (§7).

**One leaderboard, two rankings.** The prototype's Trending and Established
boards are one list with a facet: *By volume* ranks everything, *By fee
yield* ranks only pools with seven days of history (§10's assumption, kept).
The rows are an ordered list rather than a table — a leaderboard is exactly
what `<ol>` means — with a large serif rank, a 40px mark, the symbol over a
line of FDV, depth and name, the day's fees, a 24h pill and a wide fee
sparkline. The FLIP reorder, the value flash, the leader highlight and the
Stake button on hover are unchanged in behaviour and re-asserted by the
same e2e tests against the new elements. The featured card and the two
mini cards are gone; their figures are in the masthead.

**The column priorities changed with the columns.** §5's drop order (Vol
24h and Depth at 1780px, Age at 1560px) described a nine-column table.
The row now loses the sparkline below 900px, tightens below 640px, and
loses the rank numeral below 420px — the order says the rank. Depth moved
into the row's second line rather than out of the row.

**Token marks on paper.** `lib/token-mark.ts` draws a pastel disc with a
dark ink of the same hue, and the test walks all 360 hues: 5.06:1 at worst.
The badge no longer uses the provider's `logoColor` for a monogram — that
colour is a stored value derived by the previous palette, so a live row can
carry a disc the current ink was never measured against. It stays as the
backdrop under a real logo, where it does no harm.

### What did not move

The colour rule. Green still means brand, a positive number or an active
control, and red still means a negative number and nothing else; the pills,
segmented controls and the bin chart were rebuilt inside that rule. Every
honest-numbers rule in §7, with their tests. The `DataProvider` boundary —
no component reads data any differently. The waiting page, the drawer and
its focus trap, `prefers-reduced-motion`, and no horizontal overflow at
360px.

### Open, for ALFA

- **The default ranking is by volume**, as the chosen artboard shows. §1
  says every ranking defaults to fee yield. On the live chain the fee-yield
  facet is empty until a listed pool has seven days of fees, so a fee-yield
  default would open on an empty board for the first week; after that it
  is one click away. If §1's default is what is wanted, it is one line.
- **The favicon and the OG card** still carry the dark mark on black. They
  are brand assets, not the page, and were left alone until the mark itself
  is settled (§13).
- The §12 questions — the simulator's six-hours-per-tick clock and
  `/positions`'s *Est. fee yield* — and the §14 inputs remain open.
