# Depth — engineering handoff

Liquidity layer for Robinhood Chain. Users deposit into a token pool and collect a
proportional share of swap fees, paid in WETH. Two products: **Stakes** (passive,
one-token deposit, fees streamed over 7 days) and **Positions** (active, shaped
concentrated liquidity minted straight to the user's wallet). A third surface,
**Router**, lets token teams convert creator fees into permanent pool depth.

`depth.html` is the approved design prototype and the source of truth for layout,
copy, colour and interaction. Port its logic; do not redesign it. Where this doc
and the prototype disagree, this doc wins.

Read this file in full before writing any code. Build P0 only, then stop and report.

## 1. What is not negotiable

**Depth never takes custody.** Position NFTs are minted to the user's wallet.
Staked positions sit in a vault contract that only the depositing wallet can
withdraw from. There is no admin withdraw path, no pause that traps funds, no
upgradeable proxy on the vault.

**Rewards come from real swap fees only.** No token emissions, ever. If volume
slows, displayed yield slows with it. Never display a projected or subsidised APR.

**Fee yield is the headline metric, not volume.** Volume is trivially washed; fee
yield is what an LP actually earns. Every ranking defaults to fee yield.

**Displayed yield is trailing, never forward.** Label it `fee yield, trailing 7d`
everywhere. Never write "APY", never annualise a single day.

## 2. Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript | matches existing Fourtis projects |
| API | Fastify | same |
| DB | PostgreSQL + Prisma | same |
| Cache / streams | Redis | pending-harvest buffer, websocket fan-out |
| Indexer | viem + own log poller | Robinhood Chain has ~100ms blocks; see §4 |
| Contracts | Foundry, Solidity 0.8.26 | v4 hooks tooling is Foundry-first |
| Deploy | Hostinger VPS, PM2, Nginx | same as the rest of the stack |

Chain: **Robinhood Chain, chainId 4663**, EVM L2 (Arbitrum Orbit), native gas ETH.
Sequencer is first-come-first-served with ~100ms blocks, so **use timestamps, not
block numbers, for transaction deadlines**.

Known addresses to seed config (verify each on the explorer before mainnet):

```

Day-one stablecoin on this chain is **USDG**, not USDC. There is no Aave deployment.

## 3. Contracts

Four contracts. Keep them small and separately auditable.

### 3.1 `DepthZap`

Single-token entry. Takes ETH or one side of a pair, swaps the correct fraction,
mints the position, returns dust.

```
function zapMint(
  PoolKey  calldata key,
  int24    tickLower,
  int24    tickUpper,
  uint256  amountIn,
  address  tokenIn,
  uint256  minLiquidity,
  uint256  deadline
) external payable returns (uint256 tokenId);
```

- Swap fraction is computed off-chain and passed in; the contract enforces
  `minLiquidity` so a bad quote reverts rather than executing badly.
- Deadline is a **timestamp**.
- Dust below one wei-equivalent of gas is left in the contract; anything above is
  returned to the caller. Never silently keep dust.

### 3.2 `DepthShaper`

Builds a shaped position across N bins in one transaction. Uniswap v4 has ticks,
not bins, so a "bin" is one tick-range sub-position with its own weight.

```
struct Bin { int24 lower; int24 upper; uint128 weightBps; }
function mintShaped(PoolKey calldata key, Bin[] calldata bins, ...) external payable;
```

- `sum(weightBps) == 10_000` enforced on-chain.
- Max 60 bins per transaction — past that, gas and calldata make it worse than two
  transactions. Reject with a clear revert, do not silently truncate.
- Three shapes in the UI (spot / curve / bid-ask) are **weight generators in the
  frontend**, not contract modes. Keep the contract shape-agnostic so new shapes
  ship without a contract change.

### 3.3 `DepthVault`

One vault per pool. Holds staked LP, harvests fees, streams rewards.

Reward accounting is the Synthetix `StakingRewards` pattern, not a claim-on-demand
pool. The 7-day drip is what stops a wallet from depositing right before a harvest,
claiming, and leaving.

```
rewardRate        = pendingWeth / 7 days
rewardPerToken   += (now - lastUpdate) * rewardRate * 1e18 / totalSupply
earned(account)   = balance * (rewardPerToken - userPaid) / 1e18 + rewards[account]
```

- `notifyReward(uint256 amount)` extends the stream: leftover from the current
  window is folded into the new rate. Standard Synthetix `notifyRewardAmount` logic.
- `withdraw()` is always available, no lockup, no exit fee, no timelock.
- Protocol fee is taken **at harvest, from fees earned** — never from principal:

```
protocolFeeBps = 1000   // 10% of harvested fees
max allowed    = 2000   // hard cap in the constructor, cannot be raised
```

  The cap is constructor-immutable. A governance setter that can raise it to 100%
  is the single most common rug in this product category; do not ship one.

### 3.4 `DepthRouter`

For token teams: converts an accruing fee stream into pool liquidity.

- Trigger modes: `CADENCE` (every N seconds) or `MILESTONE` (at market-cap steps,
  each fires once, in ascending order).
- Pricing uses a **30-minute TWAP**, not spot, or the keeper call is a free sandwich.
- Slippage guard on every route; revert rather than route at a bad price.
- Keeper only *triggers*. Funds never leave the contract to the keeper. The keeper
  address is rotatable; the destination pool is not.
- `pause()` stops future routes and lets the owner withdraw **unrouted** fees only.
  Already-routed liquidity is not recoverable by anyone — say so in the UI.

### 3.5 Invariants for the test suite

- Vault: `sum(balances) == totalSupply`, always.
- Vault: a user who never claims and withdraws at time T receives exactly the same
  WETH as a user who claimed every hour. (Drip must not leak.)
- Vault: `protocolFeeBps` can never exceed the constructor cap.
- Vault: withdraw path works when `rewardRate == 0` and when the reward token
  balance is zero.
- Shaper: `sum(weightBps) != 10_000` reverts.
- Shaper: a 60-bin mint fits under the block gas limit.
- Zap: a quote that degrades between build and execution reverts, never partially
  fills.
- Router: a milestone fires at most once; milestones out of order revert at config
  time, not at route time.
- Router: routing at spot price when TWAP deviates more than the guard reverts.

## 4. Indexer

All pool data comes from on-chain events. No third-party price API in the critical
path — logos and token metadata may come from external sources, numbers may not.

**Sources**
- `PoolManager` v4: `Initialize`, `Swap`, `ModifyLiquidity`.
- v3 `UniswapV3Pool`: `Swap`, `Mint`, `Burn` — some older pools on this chain are v3.
- Launchpad hooks (Pons, Bags, Bottom.fun) emit their own swap events *before*
  graduation. Pre-graduation liquidity is not stakeable; index it for the listing
  but mark `stakeable: false`.

**Pipeline**
1. Poller reads logs in ranges, writes raw rows, tracks `last_indexed_block` per
   contract. Reorg depth on an Orbit L2 is shallow but non-zero: re-scan the last
   32 blocks each pass and upsert by `(txHash, logIndex)`.
2. Fee attribution per pool per hour into `pool_fee_hourly`. Fee yield is
   `fees_7d / tvl_now * 365/7 * 100` — compute it in SQL, never in the component.
3. Prices: derive from pool reserves and `sqrtPriceX96`, anchored to WETH, then to
   USD via the WETH/USDG pool. One anchor, one path, no averaging across venues.
4. Websocket pushes deltas to the client. The prototype's 3.2s tick is simulating
   this; in production, push on actual events and debounce to ~1s per pool.

**Schema sketch**

```
pools(id, address, chain_id, token0, token1, fee_tier, tick_spacing,
      hooks, protocol, created_block, stakeable)
tokens(address, symbol, name, decimals, logo_url, launchpad, first_seen)
pool_fee_hourly(pool_id, hour, fees_token0, fees_token1, fees_usd, volume_usd, swaps)
pool_state(pool_id, tvl_usd, price_usd, mc_usd, updated_at)     -- latest snapshot
vaults(pool_id, address, total_staked, reward_rate, period_finish, stakers)
stakes(wallet, vault_id, shares, claimed_weth, updated_at)
positions(token_id, wallet, pool_id, tick_lower, tick_upper, liquidity, shape, status)
router_configs(token, fee_source, mode, cadence_s, milestones_json, paused)
router_routes(config_id, tx_hash, weth_in, liquidity_added, twap_price, routed_at)
```

Rule: components read from a `DataProvider` interface. P0 ships a `SimProvider`
reproducing the prototype's generated data; P1 swaps in the live one. No component
imports data directly, so the swap is one file.

---

## 5. Design system

Take these from `depth.html` into `globals.css` as custom properties. Never
hardcode a colour in a component.

```css
--bg:      #050807;   /* page */
--panel:   #080D0B;   /* cards, table surface */
--panel-2: #0B120F;   /* row hover */
--raise:   #0E1714;   /* inset tracks, segmented control active */

--bd:      rgba(61,214,140,.12);   /* green-tinted border, pills and inputs */
--bd-2:    rgba(61,214,140,.26);   /* focus, active outline */
--bd-n:    rgba(255,255,255,.06);  /* neutral hairline, table rows and cards */

--fg:   #E6F2EC;  --fg-2: #8FA79B;  --fg-3: #5E7268;  --fg-4: #3D4D45;

--ac:     #3DD68C;  /* the one accent */
--ac-2:   #6FE8AC;
--ac-dim: rgba(61,214,140,.10);
--red:    #E5484D;  /* negative change only */
```

**Colour rule.** Green is the only accent and it means one of three things: brand,
a positive number, or an active control. Red means exactly one thing: a negative
number. Nothing else is coloured. Earlier iterations of this design failed because
colour was sprayed across the whole surface.

**Type.** JetBrains Mono throughout, Inter as the fallback stack only.
- Column headers, field labels, eyebrows: `10px / 600 / letter-spacing .16em / uppercase`
- Numbers: `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`, always
- Row values: 13px / 500. Token ticker: 14px / 700.
- Big figures (vault APR, stat cards): 24–38px / 700

**Components.** Card radius 14px, control radius 8–10px, pills 99px. Row hover is a
background lift to `--panel-2` plus a 2px green bar on the left edge. Transitions
150ms for hover, 450ms `cubic-bezier(.2,.7,.3,1)` for row reordering.

**Layout.** Fixed 232px labelled sidebar collapsing to a 64px icon rail below
1180px. Sticky top bar, 69px, holds search + the four global stats + wallet.
Columns drop by priority as width shrinks: `Vol 24h` and `Depth` at 1780px, `Age`
at 1560px. A table must never overflow its card.

---

## 6. Pages

### `/pools` — the listing
Featured pool card with 6 metrics and a full-bleed area chart; two smaller cards
(Most traded, Highest fee yield); then two live boards, Trending (sorted by volume)
and Established (sorted by fee yield), each with All / ETH / USDG quote filters.

Live behaviour, all visible in the prototype:
- values update in place, flashing green or red for ~1.1s on change
- rows reorder with a FLIP transform, never a jump
- row 1 carries a leader highlight
- a `Stake` button fades in on row hover and opens the drawer without navigating

### `/stakes`
Vault grid: trailing-7d fee yield as the headline figure, staked total, fees 24h,
staker count, next harvest countdown. Below it, the user's own stakes with a
7-day stream progress bar, claimable amount, and Claim / Compound.

### `/positions`
The shape builder. Left panel: token, deposit amount, shape (spot / curve /
bid-ask), range as ± percent, bin count. Right panel: live bin chart with the
current price marked, plus range, estimated fee yield, split at mint, fee tier.
Mint is one transaction and the NFT goes to the user.

### `/router`
Token-team surface. Fee source, trigger mode, destination range, then a plain
timeline of what will happen and a depth projection. Copy must state that routed
liquidity is permanent.

### `/portfolio`
Net value, fees earned, price impact vs holding, daily fee heatmap, position list
with in-range / out-of-range status and a rebalance prompt.

## 7. Honest-numbers rules

These are product rules, not style preferences. Breaking one makes the site
dishonest and it is the fastest way to lose LPs.

- Fee yield on a pool younger than 7 days is labelled `est.` and carries the pool
  age next to it. A 1-day-old pool showing 1200% is arithmetic, not an opportunity.
- Never display a yield figure computed from fewer than 24 hours of data. Show `—`.
- `Price impact on holdings` in the portfolio is the honest name for impermanent
  loss. Show it as a negative number next to fees earned, not buried.
- Out-of-range positions earn nothing. Say exactly that, in the row, in red.
- The protocol fee (10% of fees earned) is disclosed in the stake drawer before the
  user signs, not in a docs page.
- If the indexer is behind, show the lag in the top bar. Never render stale numbers
  as if they were live.

---

## 8. Build phases

**P0 — shell and simulated data.** Next.js scaffold, design tokens, all five pages
rendering against `SimProvider` with the prototype's generated data, including the
live tick, flash and FLIP reorder. Deploy. Nothing below changes a component.

**P1 — indexer.** Log poller, pool and token discovery, fee attribution, price
derivation, websocket. `/pools`, `/stakes`, `/portfolio` read real data. Still no
contracts.

**P2 — contracts on testnet.** `DepthZap`, `DepthShaper`, `DepthVault` with the
full invariant suite. `/positions` mints for real; `/stakes` stakes for real.

**P3 — keeper.** Harvest scheduler, WETH conversion, `notifyReward`. Monitoring and
alerting on missed harvests: a keeper that dies silently is a vault paying zero
while displaying a yield.

**P4 — router.** `DepthRouter` plus the token-team onboarding flow.

**P5 — audit, then mainnet.** No mainnet deployment of the vault before an external
audit. This is the one phase that cannot be compressed.

---

## 9. Acceptance criteria for the hard parts

**P1 is done when** re-running the indexer from block zero on a fresh database
produces byte-identical `pool_fee_hourly` rows to the incremental run, and a forced
32-block reorg replay changes no row count.

**P2 is done when** the vault invariant suite passes under fuzzing with 10k runs,
including: random deposit / withdraw / claim orderings across 50 wallets never
leave the vault unable to pay `sum(earned)`.

**P3 is done when** killing the keeper for 48 hours and restarting it distributes
exactly the fees accrued in that window, with no double-payment and no loss, and
the UI showed the harvest lag the whole time.

---

## 10. Open decisions for ALFA, not for the developer

- **Protocol fee rate.** 10% is in the spec and the prototype. Meteora runs ~10%
  and returns 90% to LPs. Going higher looks fine on a spreadsheet and loses the
  supply side. Confirm before the constructor is deployed, because the cap is
  immutable.
- **Minimum pool age before a pool appears in Established.** 7 days is assumed.
- **Whether Depth seeds its own liquidity in launch pools.** Affects whether the
  displayed TVL is honest as "user liquidity" or needs a separate line.
- **Domain and token.** `Depth` is the working name.
