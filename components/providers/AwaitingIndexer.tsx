/**
 * What the site shows when there is no snapshot.
 *
 * The honest state — §7 forbids placeholder numbers — but "waiting for the
 * indexer" on its own is a blank wall: true, and no use to whoever opens the
 * site to find out what is wrong. It had exactly that problem in production,
 * where the real answer was a missing USDG_ADDRESS and nothing on the page
 * said so.
 *
 * So it asks `/api/health`, which knows, and shows the reason. Three states
 * it can report, each meaning something different:
 *
 *   misconfigured   the indexer cannot start — the message says what to set
 *   never-indexed   configured, running, has not written its first block yet
 *   (no answer)     the API itself is down
