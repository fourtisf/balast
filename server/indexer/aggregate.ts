/**
 * The aggregations: `weth_usd_hourly`, `pool_flow_hourly`, `pool_fee_hourly`
 * and `pool_state`, all in SQL (§4.2).
 *
 * Two rules shape every query in this file.
 *
 * REBUILT, NEVER INCREMENTED. Each table is recomputed by aggregation over
 * rows keyed `(tx_hash, log_index)`. An increment is order-dependent and
 * double-counts on replay; a rebuild gives the same answer no matter how many
 * times the same logs arrive, in what order, or in what range sizes. That is
 * what makes §9's "byte-identical" provable rather than hopeful, and it is
 * why re-scanning the last 32 blocks every pass (§4.1) costs nothing.
 *
 * STAGED, SO A REBUILD IS NOT A FULL SCAN. The naive version of this file
 * summed the raw event tables for every pool on every pass and recomputed the
 * anchor's whole price series with a correlated subquery per hour. It was
 * correct and unusable: 5-9 seconds a pass on a four-thousand-swap fixture,
 * and a full table scan per second against a real chain. So the work is
 * staged into hourly tables, and each pass rebuilds only the hours it touched:
 *
 *     swap_events, liquidity_events        (raw, append-only)
 *       -> weth_usd_hourly                 the one USD anchor
 *       -> pool_flow_hourly                signed token flow, for reserves
 *       -> pool_fee_hourly                 fees and volume, valued in USD
 *       -> pool_state                      latest price, reserves, TVL
 *
 * Pricing follows §4.3 exactly: one anchor, one path.
 *
 *   WETH/USDG pool  ->  WETH in USD
 *   any TOKEN/WETH  ->  TOKEN in WETH  ->  TOKEN in USD
 *   any TOKEN/USDG  ->  TOKEN in USD
 *   anything else   ->  unpriced, and it stays unpriced
 *
 * No averaging across venues and no third-party feed. A pool with neither
 * WETH nor USDG on a side is left unpriced rather than guessed at.
