/**
 * Decoded events to database rows. Pure: no clock, no network, no database.
 *
 * This is the file §9's acceptance criterion lives or dies on. Two properties
 * make "byte-identical rows from a block-zero re-run and an incremental run"
 * true rather than hopeful:
 *
 *   1. Every row is keyed by `(txHash, logIndex)` and written by upsert, so
 *      re-scanning the last 32 blocks each pass (§4.1) rewrites identical
 *      rows. Nothing is ever incremented.
 *
 *   2. The one piece of carried state — a pool's sqrtPrice, needed to value a
 *      v4 `ModifyLiquidity` that carries no amounts — is a pure function of
 *      the event prefix under the `(blockNumber, logIndex)` total order. The
 *      caller loads it from the database rather than from memory, so a restart
 *      mid-chain resumes with exactly the state a full replay would have.
 *
 * The temptation to "just add the fees as they arrive" is what makes most
 * indexers unable to replay. It is not done here.
