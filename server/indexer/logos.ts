/**
 * Token logos, from an external token list.
 *
 * §4 draws the line precisely: "logos and token metadata may come from
 * external sources, numbers may not." So this file is allowed to fetch, and
 * it is the ONLY file in `server/` that talks to anything other than a node
 * or the database. Two rules keep it on the right side of that line:
 *
 *   It reads `logoURI` and nothing else. Not price, not supply, not decimals
 *   — decimals are an input to every price, so they stay an on-chain read
 *   even though a token list would happily supply them.
 *
 *   A failure is silent and total. No list, an unreachable host, malformed
 *   JSON: every token keeps the colour derived from its address, and not one
 *   number on the site changes. A logo is decoration; the site works without
 *   one and must never wait on one.
 *
 * The list is opt-in via TOKEN_LIST_URL, because there is no canonical list
 * for this chain yet and guessing at one would be worse than no logos.
 *
 * It accepts a LOCAL PATH as well as a URL, which matters more than it looks.
 * Robinhood Chain has no public token list, so waiting for one means no token
 * ever gets a real logo. A file in the repository — `config/tokens.json` —
 * lets whoever knows the tokens supply logos for the ones that matter today,
 * in the same Uniswap token-list shape a public list would use, so switching
 * to one later is a one-line change.
