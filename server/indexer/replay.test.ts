/**
 * §9's acceptance criterion for P1, as a test.
 *
 *   "P1 is done when re-running the indexer from block zero on a fresh
 *    database produces byte-identical `pool_fee_hourly` rows to the
 *    incremental run, and a forced 32-block reorg replay changes no row
 *    count."
 *
 * Both halves are checked against a real Postgres, through the real SQL, over
 * a deterministic fixture chain of ABI-encoded logs — the decoder, the ingest
 * planner and the aggregation are all on the path, none of them mocked.
 *
 * Byte-identical means byte-identical: every numeric column is compared as
 * text, because comparing Postgres `numeric` through a JavaScript float would
 * hide the drift this criterion exists to catch.
