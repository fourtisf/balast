/**
 * Finding the USD anchor without being told.
 *
 * §4.3 allows exactly one path to a dollar figure: the WETH/USDG pool prices
 * WETH, and everything else prices through WETH. §2 names USDG as the day-one
 * stablecoin but not its address, so until now the indexer refused to start
 * until a human looked the address up and set `USDG_ADDRESS`.
 *
 * That is a bad design, and it showed: the site sat on a "not configured"
 * page waiting for a step only a person could take. The indexer already reads
 * every token's symbol off its own contract while discovering pools — it has
 * the answer in its own tables. So it looks.
 *
 * The order this can happen in is the interesting part, and it works because
 * of a decision made much earlier: aggregates are REBUILT, never incremented.
 * So the indexer can write raw rows with no anchor at all, discover the anchor
 * later, and the next rebuild prices everything retroactively. Nothing needs
 * a second pass over the chain.
 *
 * Where it will not guess: if two tokens both call themselves USDG, the wrong
 * choice makes every dollar figure on the site wrong in a way nothing
 * downstream can detect. It picks the one with real depth, says so, and
 * reports both — and `USDG_ADDRESS` still overrides everything.
