/**
 * The RPC layer, with failover.
 *
 * §4 puts all pool data on-chain, which makes the RPC endpoint the single
 * point of failure for every number on the site. Public endpoints rate-limit,
 * time out and occasionally serve a stale head, so every call goes through
 * `withFailover`: try each endpoint in order, and only surface an error once
 * all of them have refused.
 *
 * There is deliberately no price API here and no third-party indexer. The
 * only thing this module talks to is a node (§4).
