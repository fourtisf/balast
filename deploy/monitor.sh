# §8's P3 criterion names the failure this exists for: "a keeper that dies
# silently is a vault paying zero while displaying a yield". The same is true
# of the indexer one phase early — the site keeps serving its last snapshot,
# with a lag figure climbing in a corner of the top bar that nobody is looking
# at. The lag display is for a user who is on the page; this is for the hours
# when nobody is.
#
# It checks three things that fail independently:
#   the API answers at all
#   the indexer is not stalled  (/api/health returns 503 when it is)
#   the PM2 processes are online
#
# Alerting is whatever ALERT_CMD is set to, so this does not pick a vendor.
# With it unset, output goes to the log and the exit code is non-zero, which
# cron will mail to root on a box with a working MTA.
